# Preprocessing tool for TGSIM dataset

This reposit allows for the preprocessing of TGSIM datasets. It allows you to load data from one specific experiment, transform coordinates into traffic exploitable ones, retrive leader for each vehicle and compute distance, time and speed headways.<br>

## How to run the code?
1. First create a conda environnement using the env\TGSIM_environment.yml file.<br>
More informations on how to do it on https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html

2. Load the environnement "conda activate TGSIM_env" from your console or the anaconda navigator.

3. Run the script.ipynb file.

## Notes 
We advise you tyo save your data on the provided data folder and to create a subfolder in the data folder to save the transformed data.<br>
This script can be used to devellop your resarch. Use it as a starter pack for using TGSIM data.<br>

### Happy coding!
