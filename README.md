# Preprocessing tool for TGSIM dataset

This reposit allows for the preprocessing of TGSIM datasets*. It allows you to load data from one specific experiment, transform coordinates into traffic exploitable ones, retrive leader for each vehicle and compute distance, time and speed headways.<br>
The urls for each TGSIM experiment is available at the where to download markdown file in the data folder.

## How to run the code?
1. First create a conda environnement using the env\TGSIM_environment.yml file.<br>
More informations on how to do it on https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html

2. Load the environnement "conda activate TGSIM_env" from your console or the anaconda navigator.

3. Run the script.ipynb file.

## Notes 
We advise you tyo save your data on the provided data folder and to create a subfolder in the data folder to save the transformed data.<br>
This script can be used to devellop your resarch. Use it as a starter pack for using TGSIM data.<br>
